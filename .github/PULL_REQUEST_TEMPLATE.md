STOP!!!  If you are new to git and do not understand the mechanics of forks, branches, and pulls, DO NOT CONTINUE.

- Have you created an issue for what you're changing? (not necessary for documentation changes)
- Have you created a new branch for your contribution?
- Have you added "// Modified for Turbo" and "// Modified for OpenFTC" comments as appropriate? (See the contributing guide)
- Do you have the base branch set to develop? (Set it to master for documentation changes)
